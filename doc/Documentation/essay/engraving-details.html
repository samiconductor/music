<p>The art of music typography is called <em>(plate) engraving</em>, a term
that derives from the manual process of music printing<sup><a name="DOCF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>.  Just a few decades ago, sheet music was made by
cutting and stamping the music into a zinc or pewter plate in mirror
image.  The plate would be inked, and the depressions caused by the
cutting and stamping would hold ink.  An image was formed by pressing
paper to the plate.  The stamping and cutting was done completely by hand
and making a correction was cumbersome, so the engraving had to be
nearly perfect in one go.  Engraving was a highly specialized skill; a
craftsman had to complete around five years of training before earning
the title of master engraver, and another five years of experience were
necessary to become truly skilled.

<p>LilyPond is inspired by traditional manual engravings published by
European music publishers in and towards the end of the first half of
the twentieth century, including Bärenreiter, Duhem, Durand,
Hofmeister, Peters, and Schott.  This is sometimes regarded as the peak
of traditional musical engraving practice.  As we have studied these
editions we have learned a great deal about what goes into a
well-engraved score, and the aspects that we wanted to imitate in
LilyPond.

<p>The images below illustrate some differences between traditional
engraving and typical computer output.  The left picture shows a scan of
a flat symbol from a hand-engraved Bärenreiter edition, while the right
picture depicts a symbol from an edition of the same music published in
2000.  Although both images are printed in the same shade of ink, the
earlier version looks darker: the staff lines are heavier, and the
Bärenreiter flat has a bold, almost voluptuous rounded look.  The right
scan, on the other hand, has thinner lines and a straight layout with
sharp corners.

<a name="index-balance"></a>

<p>When we wanted to write a computer program to create music typography,
there were no musical fonts freely available that could match the
elegance of our favorite scores.  Undeterred, we created a font of
musical symbols, relying on nice printouts of hand-engraved music.  The
experience helped develop a typographical taste, and it made us
appreciate subtle design details.  Without that experience, we would not
have realized how ugly the fonts were that we admired at first.
</p>
<p>Below is a sample of two music fonts: the upper set is the default font
in the Sibelius software (the <em>Opus</em> font), and the lower set is
our own LilyPond font.
</p>
<blockquote><img src="../pictures/OpusAndFeta.png" alt="png">
</blockquote>

<p>The LilyPond symbols are heavier and their weight is more consistent,
which makes them easier to read.  Fine endings, such as the ones on the
sides of the quarter rest, should not end in sharp points, but rather
in rounded shapes.  This is because sharp corners of the punching dies
are fragile and quickly wear out when stamping in metal.  Taken together,
the blackness of the font must be carefully tuned together with the
thickness of lines, beams and slurs to give a strong yet balanced
overall impression.
</p>
<p>Also, notice that our half-note head is not elliptic but slightly diamond
shaped.  The vertical stem of a flat symbol is slightly brushed, becoming
wider at the top.  The sharp and the natural are easier to distinguish
from a distance because their angled lines have different slopes and the
vertical strokes are heavier.

<h3 class="unnumberedsubsec">Optical spacing</h3>

<p>In spacing, the distribution of space should reflect the durations
between notes.  However, as we saw in the Bach Suite above, many modern
scores adhere to the durations with mathematical precision, which leads
to poor results.  In the next example a motif is printed twice: the
first time using exact mathematical spacing, and the second with
corrections.  Which do you prefer?

<a name="index-regular-rhythms"></a>
<a name="index-regular-spacing"></a>
<a name="index-spacing_002c-regular"></a>

<p>Each bar in the fragment only uses notes that are played in a constant
rhythm.  The spacing should reflect that.  Unfortunately, the eye deceives
us a little; not only does it notice the distance between note heads, it
also takes into account the distance between consecutive stems.  As a
result, the notes of an up-stem/down-stem combination should be put
farther apart, and the notes of a down-stem/up-stem combination should
be put closer together, all depending on the combined vertical positions
of the notes.  The lower two measures are printed with this correction,
the upper two measures, however, form down-stem/up-stem clumps of
notes.  A master engraver would adjust the spacing as needed to please
the eye.
</p>
<p>The spacing algorithms in LilyPond even take the barlines into account,
which is why the final up-stem in the properly spaced example has been
given a little more space before the barline to keep it from looking
crowded.  A down-stem would not need this adjustment.

<a name="index-ledger-lines"></a>
<a name="index-collisions"></a>

<p>Ledger lines present a typographical challenge: they make it more
difficult to space musical symbols close together and they must be clear
enough to identify the pitch at a glance.  In the example below, we see
that ledger lines should be thicker than normal staff lines and that an
expert engraver will shorten a ledger line to allow closer spacing with
accidentals.  We have included this feature in LilyPond&rsquo;s engraving.

<h3 class="unnumberedsubsec">Optical sizing</h3>

<p>Music may need to be printed in a range of sizes.  Originally, this was
accomplished by creating punching dies in each of the required sizes,
which meant that each die was designed to look its best at that size.
With the advent of digital fonts, a single outline can be mathematically
scaled to any size, which is very convenient, but at the smaller sizes
the glyphs will appear very light.
</p>
<p>In LilyPond, we have created fonts in a range of weights, corresponding
to a range of music sizes.  This is a LilyPond engraving at staff size
26:
</p>
<blockquote><img src="../pictures/size26.png" alt="png">
</blockquote>

<p>and this is the same engraving set at staff size 11, then
magnified by 236% to print at the same size as the previous example:
</p>
<blockquote><img src="../pictures/size11.png" alt="png">
</blockquote>

<p>At smaller sizes, LilyPond uses proportionally heavier lines so the
music will still read well.

<h3 class="unnumberedsubsec">Why work so hard?</h3>

<p>Musicians are usually more absorbed with performing than with studying
the looks of a piece of music, so nitpicking typographical details may
seem academic.  But it is not.  Sheet music is performance material:
everything is done to aid the musician in letting her perform better,
and anything that is unclear or unpleasant to read is a hindrance.
</p>
<p>Traditionally engraved music uses bold symbols on heavy staff to create
a strong, well-balanced look that stands out well when the music is far
away from the reader: for example, if it is on a music stand.  A careful
distribution of white space allows music to be set very tightly without
crowding symbols together.  The result minimizes the number of page
turns, which is a great advantage.
</p>
<p>This is a common characteristic of typography.  Layout should be pretty,
not only for its own sake, but especially because it helps the reader in
his task.  For sheet music this is of double importance because musicians
have a limited amount of attention.  The less attention they need for
reading, the more they can focus on playing the music.  In other words,
better typography translates to better performances.
</p>
<p>These examples demonstrate that music typography is an art that is
subtle and complex, and that producing it requires considerable
expertise, which musicians usually do not have.  LilyPond is our
effort to bring the graphical excellence of hand-engraved music to
the computer age, and make it available to normal musicians.  We
have tuned our algorithms, font-designs, and program settings to
produce prints that match the quality of the old editions we love
to see and love to play from.

<h3>Footnotes</h3>
<p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="FOOT1" href="#DOCF1">1</a>]</small> Early
European printers explored several processes, including hand-carved
wooden blocks, movable type, and engraved sheets of thin metal.
Typesetting had the advantage of being more easily corrected and
facilitating the inclusion of text and lyrics, but only engraving
offered the ability to do unimpeded layout and unanticipated notation.
In the end, hand-engraved scores became the standard for all printed
music, with the exception of some hymnals and songbooks where
typesetting was justified by its ease and economy, even into the
twentieth century.

<!--
we depend on an external entity here, which we cannot control.  Suppose
we go from 2.16.x to 2.17.x and put the documentation under "v2.17".
For some time, Google won't have the new location in its index, so the
search would get nothing.  It would be better to keep "v2.16" in the
search for a while and have a redirection from "v2.16" to "v2.17".
