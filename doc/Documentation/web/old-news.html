<h4 class="subsubheading">LilyPond 2.14.0 released! <em>June 6, 2011</em></h4>

<p>We are proud to announce the release of GNU LilyPond 2.14.
LilyPond is a music engraving program, devoted to producing the
highest-quality sheet music possible.  It brings the aesthetics of
traditionally engraved music to computer printouts.
</p>
<p>Many improvements have been made in the past two and a half years
since the previous main stable version.  A few major improvements
are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
LilyPond is now licensed under the GNU GPL v3 or higher.

</li><li>
The vertical spacing engine has been drastically changed, making
it much more flexible and easier to control.

</li><li>
Automatic beaming is now more flexible, and beam collisions are
avoided.

</li></ul>

<p>A full list of new features is given in:

<p>LilyPond 2.5.6 was released. This is a &quot;technology preview&quot;
release, which means that it has all kinds of nifty
features, but is not actually usable for producing nicely
printed scores. For this reason, an RPM of this release was
not produced. The PS backend is now completely switched over
to Pango/FontConfig: for -f ps, LilyPond only accepts UTF8
input, all text fonts are loaded through Pango, the TeX
backend now offloads all metric computations to LaTeX, the
SVG and GNOME backends are broken, most probably.

layout editor. You can add and remove things from the file,
and the tweaks will still work, as long as the tweaked notes
remain in the place (ie. start at the same time-wise and be
part of the same context). Further attractions are: the
gnome backend now also draws beams and slurs, updates to the
SVG backend, support for the lmodern font set for TeX,
various bugfixes.

pass note heads much closer than the average distance get an extra
penalty. This fixes a lot of difficult slurring cases. See
input/regression/new-slur for some examples.
Please consider this release as a 3.0 pre-release so try to find as
many bugs as possible. A report including a small .ly example
can be filed at bug-lilypond@gnu.org
In this case, a bug is defined as something that the current 2.3 does
worse than the latest 2.2 release.  We want to be sure that no output
will get uglier by upgrading to 3.0, so that once 3.0 is out, nothing
will hold users back in switching.

now once-again directly runs the binary. The old wrapper script has
been renamed to lilypond-latex.py, and should only be used for legacy
projects. The recommended route is either using lilypond directly
(with \book, you can have multiple movements within one document), or
to run lilypond-book with a LaTeX wrapper file.
This release also fixes a bunch of small errors.  I now consider
LilyPond feature complete for a 3.0 release.  Next on the TODO list is
updating the manual, and after that&rsquo;s done we can release 3.0. The

The slur formatting has been rewritten. The new slur code
works similar to the Beam formatter: scores are assigned for

Slurs will now also take into account collisions with staff
lines, scripts (like staccato and accent) and accidentals. In

we go from 2.16.x to 2.17.x and put the documentation under "v2.17".
